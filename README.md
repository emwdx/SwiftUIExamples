# SwiftUIExamples
This is a set of SwiftUI element examples that I use with my App Development class for prototyping.

To use:
* You can open the Swift Playgrounds Book in the Playgrounds app on a computer running macOS 11 or above. Each page contains a single example of a SwiftUI element.
* You can also copy and paste the code for the elements you want to use directly into the SwiftUI template page.
* For each element, be sure to copy the code between the comments titled 'variables' into the main SwiftUI template _above_ the code for the body.
* You should also copy and paste the code between the UI Code comment lines into the VStack for the body where you want the element to appear.
